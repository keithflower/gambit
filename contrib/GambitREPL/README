This program implements the "Gambit REPL dev" application for iOS
and Android devices.  It is a simple development environment for Scheme.  The user
can interact with a REPL, edit/save/run small scripts, and upload
scripts to a public script repository.

For iOS, the example was tested with iOS 4.3 and XCode 4.0 .  If you do not have
these versions, some adjustments will be needed at the top of the
gambit/misc/build-gambit-iOS shell script, and possibly other places.

For Android, the example was tested with Android 1.6, android-ndk-r8e, and 
android-5 platform. If you do not have these versions, again some adjustments 
will be needed in the gambit/misc/build-gambit-android shell script, and 
possibly other places.
